# Diabetes Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict the onset of diabetes in individuals based on various features such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, etc. The prediction is done using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification.

## Dependencies
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Data Collection and Analysis
### Dataset
The PIMA Diabetes Dataset is used for this project. It consists of 768 rows and 9 columns, where the 'Outcome' column indicates whether an individual is diabetic (1) or non-diabetic (0).

#### Features
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
- Age

#### Target
- Outcome (0: Non-Diabetic, 1: Diabetic)

## Data Preprocessing
### Standardization
The data is standardized using `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn to ensure that all features have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

## Model Building
### Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier
A linear SVM classifier is used for this project. The model is trained on the standardized training data.

## Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using the accuracy score on both the training and test datasets.

### Results
- Training data accuracy: 78.66%
- Test data accuracy: 77.27%

## Predictive System
A predictive system is implemented to make predictions on new data. Users can input their data, and the system will predict whether the person is diabetic or not.

### Example Input
```
input_data = (5, 166, 72, 19, 175, 25.8, 0.587, 51)
```

### Predicted Output
```
The person is diabetic
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd diabetes-prediction
    ```
3. Run the `Project 3 - Diabetes Prediction.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to see the code implementation and results.
